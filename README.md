# PonyGalaMobile
This project is a combination of all my new and old Android app development knowledge that has been gathered here with one goal: to create a simple native lightweight mobile client for my ponygala art project. With this app, you can explore thousands of beautiful pieces of art created by the most talented artists from around the world, which Mura and I search for you every week. This project has its flaws, but it is well optimized for various devices from old and budget to flagmans. Just enjoy!
